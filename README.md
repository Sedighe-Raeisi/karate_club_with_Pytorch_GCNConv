I prepaired this repository to show how we prepaire the data for Pytorch GNN and how we can make a model for a node classification problem.
In the first section we make our model. It is a combination of two GCNConv layer, and a linear layer. In two first layer we derive the node embeddings and in the linear layer we use them to do classification task.
